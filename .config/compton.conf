# Set VSync method. VSync methods currently available:
# none: No VSync
# drm: VSync with DRM_IOCTL_WAIT_VBLANK. May only work on some drivers.
# opengl: Try to VSync with SGI_video_sync OpenGL extension.
#   Only work on some drivers.
# opengl-oml: Try to VSync with OML_sync_control OpenGL extension.
#   Only work on some drivers.
# opengl-swc: Try to VSync with SGI_swap_control OpenGL extension.
#   Only work on some drivers. Works only with GLX backend.
#   Known to be most effective on many drivers. Does not actually control
#   paint timing, only buffer swap is affected, so it doesnâ€™t have
#   the effect of --sw-opti unlike other methods. Experimental.
# opengl-mswc: Try to VSync with MESA_swap_control OpenGL extension.
#   Basically the same as opengl-swc above, except the extension we use.
# (Note some VSync methods may not be enabled at compile time.)
